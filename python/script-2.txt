Oh who's off stage?
Okay I'll be the off stage.
Okay, there's one person standing alone on stage, we can see their activity on the screen, and the way that they're represented on the screen is not what they actually look like.
There are ominous warnings flashing on screen that the power is about to go out.
Okay-
He's taping on the screen.
Our character is tapping on the screen, suddenly there are ominous warnings appearing on the screen that the power might go out.
Oh no! I heard about this happening in another place, is this real?
On screen.
Oh not the on screen
No that's not real, that's just fake news, somebody trying to fool you. That never really happens, do not be distracted from the truth of your own body.
did you hear that?
What was that? I heard something too.
Crashing sounds, the power cuts and the screen disappears, there is the sound of feedback, then silence... the actor is alone, they take off their headsets, they are disheveled and disoriented.
What just happened? Is this real?
Tectonic assurance is fragile ground.
What happened to the network? They won't reboot it, what's going on?
Then you get on the stage... the person comes on stage-
The voice over actor comes on stage.
The truth is the emptiness in the middle of the atom.
Who are you? Did you destroy my network? Are you some kid of terrorist?
The truth is the impressionability of matter, of us, the truth is a space we fight to shape.
