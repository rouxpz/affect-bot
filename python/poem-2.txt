do not be distracted from the truth
that you make with your own body
Solidity is a useful illusion
It gets us through the day
solidity (gets us) resists us
tectonic assurance is fragile ground
the truth is the emptiness in the middle of the atom
the truth is the impressionability of matter, of us,
the truth is the space we fight to shape
